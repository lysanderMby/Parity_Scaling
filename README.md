# Parity_Scaling

The sparse parity problem, where a machine learning algorithm is tasked with learning a parity check operation over large amounts of noise, is a classic test for learning processes.

Here, we find a special case of the sparse parity problem which experiences a sudden change in performance. This grokking event is far more sudden than others studied, such as over [modular addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02177) which experiences increases in generalisation capability over thousands of epochs. In comparison, grokking events on some modifications of the sparse parity problem can happen over tens of epochs.
